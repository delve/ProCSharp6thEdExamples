<h1><i>GAME MAKER</i> version 6.1A</h1>

Writing computer games normally is a lot of work
and requires skill in programming. So wouldn't it
be nice if you could make your own games in an
easy way? <i>Game Maker</i> was written to do just that.
It allows you to make all sorts of 2-dimensional
games using some simple clicking and drag-and-drop
with your mouse. But even though it is simple to use,
<i>Game Maker</i> allows you to make appealing games, with
animated graphics, backgrounds, sounds, etc. And
with its built-in programming language the
possibilities are infinite.

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> comes with a collection of freeware
images and sounds to get you started. Also there
are a number of example games, in particular
versions of popular games like Pacman and 1945.

A modern PC (Pentium or higher) running Windows 98SE,
ME, 2000, or XP is required. After installation
the program uses about 5 MB disk space. The program 
requires at least 65000 colors (high color, 16-bit).
It requires at least 800x600 screen resolution.
A 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 8 or
higher and  with at least 16 MB of video
memory is required (preferable 32 MB).

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<P>
This section provides solutions for some problems that you might
encounter when installing or running <i>Game Maker</i>.

<h2>General Issues</h2>

<P>
<B>When I start <I>Game Maker</I> it indicates that it cannot locate the library folder?</B><BR>

Action libraries must be stores in a folder called lib in the <I>Game Maker</I> folder. 
Make sure all files ending in .lib are in a folder lib in the Game Maker folder. 
Also make sure you run the program from its main location.
(You can make a shortcut to it but don't copy the program to a different location.) 
You might want to remove the program (and previous version of it) and reinstall it.

<P>
<B>When I create an object no actions are shown?</B><BR>

This is cause by the same problem as above.

<P>
<B>When running a game or creating a stand-alone executable the program 
complains that it cannot find the rundata file?</B><BR>

The file rundata must be in the <I>Game Maker</I> folder. If it is not there you did 
something strange when installing the program. For example, you might have copied 
the program to a different location, rather than making a shortcut. 
You might want to remove the program (and previous version of it) and reinstall it.

<P>
<B>When running a game the program complains that it cannot save the game
information.</B><BR>

<I>Game Maker</I> saves the game in a temporary folder. It takes the correct 
place from the environment variables that indicate the temp folder. If these 
are pointing to a place where you don't have write permission
this error can occur. Make sure they point to the correct place. 
A final reason might be that your disk is full or you are over your disk quotum.

<P>
<B>When creating a stand-alone executable the program complains 
that it cannot save the game information.</B><BR>

You are trying to save the game data at a place where you don't have write permission. 
This is for example caused when you edit games directly from the CD and try to save the
game in the default location. Try saving some place else. A final reason might be \
that your disk is full or you are over your disk quotum.

<P>
<B>When starting the room editor only three tabs are shown and I cannot use tiles or views.</B><BR>

You are running <I>Game Maker</I> in simple mode. Go to the file menu and select Advanced mode.


<h2>Graphics Issues</h2>

<P>
<B>A game you run complains about not being able to use Direct3D.</B><BR>

Game Maker requires a 3D graphics card with preferably at least 16 MB of video memory. Also it
requires DirectX version 8.0 or later to be installed on your computer. Make sure you have a recent version
of DirectX. (You can download it at the
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&categoryid=2"  target="_blank">Microsoft DirectX page</A>.) If the problem is still there you are recommended to update your graphics card drivers.
If that does not help, your card most likely is not up to it. In this case the best option is to buy a new graphics card (even the cheapest currently available card will do). Alternatively you can use the older version 5.3 of
<i>Game Maker</i> You can download this version from the <a HREF="http://www.gamemaker.nl/old.html">Old Versions Page</a>.

<P>
<B>A game you run complains about a missing DLL (most likely D3DX8.DLL).</B><BR>

This means that DirectX version 8.0 or later is not correctly installed on your computer. 
You can download the most recent version at 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&categoryid=2"  class="tekst" target="_blank">Microsoft DirectX page</A>.

<P>
<B>A game you run complains that is cannot create drawing surfaces.</B><BR>

This means that your graphics card does not satisfy the specs. You can try to reduce the screen resolution
and set the colordepth to 16-bits to save memory and check again. Also you might want to
install the most recent graphics card drivers and DirectX version. Otherwise, you will need a better graphics card.


<h2>Sound Issues</h2>

<P>
<B>A game you run crashes near to the end of loading the game.</B><BR>

This is normally due to the fact that the sound card drivers for you sound card are not
up to date. Try to get the most recent drivers. Also get the most recent graphics card
drivers as these might also cause the problem.

<P>
<B>No sound is heard.</B><BR>

This is normally caused by the same issues as in the previous problem. Update your drivers. If only the
mp3 files are not playing, you can use midi files for the background music instead. For all games we
provided such files as well.
