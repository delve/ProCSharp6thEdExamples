ATTENTION:

The Program folder contains the installer for Game Maker 6.1.a.  This is the version that matches the text of Game Maker’s Apprentice. 

However, if you have trouble getting that version to run on Windows, we have also included Game Maker 8.0. The installer is in folder GM8. If you are running Windows 7 or later, Game Maker 8.0 is the best version to install, and it also works with the text of Game Maker’s Companion.
